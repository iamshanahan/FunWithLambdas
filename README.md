# FunWithLambdas
Exercising Lambdas for my own betterment

On the one hand, I wanted to exercise my understanding of the low-level behavior of lambdas in java.  On the other hand, I wanted to create a canonical example of what does and doesn't work wrt that low-level behavior.  I'm still exploring this "tutorial in a project" idea.

This one's pretty simple.  Main ideas explored are: syntax for varying numbers of lambda parameters, how generic types are resolved in the case of a generic functional interface and a generic context (outer function), and how default and static interface members behave when using lambdas.  To be added, maybe eventually, scoping issues.

To use download code (I use eclipse).  Browse code, look at each example for what it demonstrates.  Things that don't work are commented out--uncomment them to see the error.  A working alternative should be nearby.
